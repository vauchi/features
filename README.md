**Total**: 514 scenarios | **Implemented**: ~245 (~48%)

> **Note**: Future features have been moved to `features/future/` to clearly separate planned-but-unimplemented features from active development. See `features/future/README.md` for details.

## Priority Definitions

- **P0 (Core)**: Required for MVP. Must work before any release.
- **P1 (Security)**: Security-critical features. Required for public launch.
- **P2 (Infrastructure)**: Relay, federation, labels. Enhances reliability.
- **P3 (Post-launch)**: Advanced privacy features. Opt-in, can ship later.

### P1: Security Features

**security.feature**
- E2E encryption (XChaCha20-Poly1305)
- Signature verification (Ed25519)
- MITM detection, replay prevention
- Code: `vauchi-core/src/crypto/`

**visibility_control.feature**

See `features/future/README.md` for implementation notes.

## Running Scenario Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (includes scenario coverage)
cargo test

# Run tests for specific feature area
cargo test identity
cargo test exchange
cargo test sync
```

## Adding New Scenarios

1. Write scenario in appropriate `.feature` file
2. Write failing test referencing the scenario
3. Implement minimal code to pass
4. Refactor while green

See `docs/TDD_RULES.md` for methodology.
